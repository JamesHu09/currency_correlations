Through this project, I found the correlations in value fluctuation relative to USD between the world's most traded currencies from 2000 to 2017 and 6 months.
Of the top ten traded currencies, had to exclude USD, as USD is constant relative to USD and thus has no fluctuation. 
The remaining 9 currencies were from Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China, the European Union, New Zealand, Sweden, Great Britain, and Canada.
The three strongest correlations were (Canada, Australia), (New Zealand, Australia), and (Canada, European Union).
The three smallest correlations were (Japan, Great Britain), (Hong Kong, Great Britain), and (New Zealand, Great Britain).
New Zealand, the European Union, Sweden, Australia, and Canada all had currencies that had a somewhat strong correlation with each other.
China and Japan demonstrated moderate correlations with each other and with most other countries.
Hong Kong and Great Britain both had currencies that only showed weak correlations with other currencies.
Great Britain was an outlier, showing far weaker correlations than the other countries.
